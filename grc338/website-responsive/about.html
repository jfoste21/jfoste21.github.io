          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>This service was inspired from a conversation with friends of the founder. Being from a friend group with so many bold personalities and opinions has always made it hard to choose a single restaurant to eat at. The goal of this service is to settle the endless quarrel about where to eat, while still being able to enjoy a meal out with your friends. We hope that you all are happy and satisfied with the services and experiences we can provide to you at a discount rate!</p>
