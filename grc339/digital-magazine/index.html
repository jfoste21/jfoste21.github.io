                  <p>
                     With just a little imagination and perhaps a coat of paint or some new hardware, an old cabinet, table or chair can get new life as something fresh and unique.

                  <p>
                     We all know that you’re supposed to reduce, reuse and recycle, but for artists, reuse and recycle often have totally different meanings than they do for the rest of us. Here are 11 artists specializing in making trash into artistic treasures.

                  <h3>Musicians Turning Trash into Musical Treasure</h3>
                  <p>
                     The history of upcycling in a musical context is robust. The avant-garde movement has long been associated with rule-breaking instrumentation. Today, environmental principles often guide the artists who choose to work with upcycled or modified instruments.

                  <h3>Fashion REFashioned, bid on upcycled clothing in Delray Beach</h3>
                  <p>
                     The fashion industry creates a lot of waste. It’s responsible for large amounts of carbon emissions, pollution in oceans and landfills, and water consumption. A local effort aims to re-purpose and inform the public in a fun way.
